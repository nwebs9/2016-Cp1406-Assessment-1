<h2>About Cosieplay</h2>
<p>CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create outstanding custom-made<br>
costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume – from a simple Spiderman or elf costume up to costumes that<br>
include advanced features such as armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. Depending<br>
on the difficulty, costumes can take between 1 – 50 weeks and cost anywhere between $10 and $10,000.We buy and<br>
sell second-hand costumes (a price list is available on the costumes page) as well.<br>
<br>
On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay Party” at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for<br>
ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. The parties start<br>
at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).</p>

<h2>What is Cosplay</h2>
<p>Cosplay, a portmanteau of the words costume play, is a performance art in which participants called<br>
cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often<br>
interact to create a subculture and a broader use of the term "cosplay" applies to any costumed role-playing<br>
in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a<br>
subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched. Favorite sources include manga and anime, comic books<br>
and cartoons, video games, and live-action films and television series.

<br>
<br>
The rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since 1990 has made the phenomenon a significant<br>
aspect of popular culture in Japan and some other parts of Asia and in the Western world. Cosplay events are<br>
common features of fan conventions and there are also dedicated conventions and local and international competitions,<br>
as well as social networks, websites and other forms of media centered on cosplay activities.<br>
